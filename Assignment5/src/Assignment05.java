    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write any code here that you may wish to test your methods defined below.

    }

    // 1) Write (define) a static method named displayGreeting,
    //  that takes no arguments and returns no value.
    //  When this function is called, it should print the text "Hello, and welcome!".


    //2) Write (define) a static method named displayText,
    //  that takes a single String argument and returns no value.
    //  When this function is called, it should print the value of the argument that was passed to it.


    //3) Write (define) a static method named printTotal,
    //  that takes three int arguments.
    //  When this function is called, it should print the sum of the three arguments passed to it.
    //  This function should return no value.


    //4) Write (define) a static method named getTotal,
    //  that takes three int arguments.
    //  When this function is called, it should return the sum
    //  of the three arguments passed to it as an int.


    //5) Write (define) a static method named getAverage,
    //  that takes three int arguments.
    //  When this function is called, it should return the average
    //  of the three arguments passed to it as a double.


    //6) Write (define) a static method named averageLength,
    //  that takes three String arguments.
    //  When this function is called, it should return the average length (number of characters)
    //  of the String arguments passed to it as a double.


    //7) Write (define) a static method named lengthOfShortest,
    //  that takes two String arguments. When this function is called,
    //  it should return the length (number of characters)
    //  of the shortest String argument passed to it as an int.


    //8) Write (define) a static method named stringOfStars,
    //  that takes one String argument.
    //  When this function is called, it should return a String of asterisks (*)
    //  that is the same length as the string argument passed to it.


    //9) Write (define) a static method named maxStringOfStars,
    //  that takes two String arguments.
    //  When this function is called, it should return a String of asterisks (*)
    //  that is the same length as the longest string argument passed to it.


    //10) Write (define) a static method named midStringOfStars,
    //   that takes three String arguments.
    //   When this function is called, it should return a String of asterisks (*)
    //   that is the same length as the string argument with the length
    //   that would be in the middle if the lengths of the arguments were arranged in ascending order.
